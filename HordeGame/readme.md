# The Project
It's a game that I've done by following [his](https://www.tomlooman.com/) tutorial, with some additions of my own. It's a Horde Spawning game that has unlimited amount of waves.
There are 2 AI types, one is a ball and is rushing to you to explode and deal damage, the second one is similar to the player but with a different color. It is a bit more advanced
but is still quite simple. He will try to get close to you and once that happens. It will try to find an advantageous position and engage you.
