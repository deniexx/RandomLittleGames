# SimpleFPSTemplate
I'm using the SimpleFPSTemplate made by Tom Looman in this project.
[More Info](https://www.tomlooman.com/fps-template/)

# The Project
It's a game that I've done by following [his](https://www.tomlooman.com/) tutorial, with some additions of my own. The game also has a multiplayer functionality.

# Multiplayer
To use Package the game
Open console, using the ~ key
To Host:
Open FirstPersonExampleMap?listen

To Connect:
Open {IPofPerson}:7777

# Troubleshooting
If you are unable to connect to the person who is hosting, he should make sure he has port 7777 enabled in his router, port-forwarding might be required.
